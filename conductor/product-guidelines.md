# Product Guidelines: Schweitzer PTA Website

## Tone and Voice
- **Warm and Welcoming:** The primary tone should be friendly and inclusive, ensuring parents, teachers, and community members feel like a valued part of the school family.
- **Energetic and Inspiring:** Use motivating language that highlights the positive impact of the PTA to encourage volunteerism and active participation in school events.
- **Clear and Direct:** While being warm, communication should remain concise and easy to understand to ensure information is conveyed effectively.

## Visual Identity
- **Community-Centric & Vibrant:** The design should celebrate school spirit and student success. Use a bright, energetic color palette that feels lively and positive.
- **Engaging Imagery:** Prioritize photos of community events, student achievements (with proper permissions), and school life to foster a sense of belonging.
- **Consistent Branding:** Ensure a cohesive look and feel across all pages to build recognition and trust.

## User Experience and Accessibility
- **Ease of Use:** The platform must be intuitive and easy to navigate for users of all technical skill levels. Information should be logically organized and reachable with minimal clicks.
- **Mobile-First Design:** Given that many parents will access the site on the go, the experience must be seamless on mobile devices.
- **Inclusivity:** Adhere to accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) to ensure that the website is usable by everyone in the community, including those with disabilities.
